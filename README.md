# Solana Name Servcie Go SDK

This is a rewrite of the [SNS](https://www.sns.id) Typescript [SDK](https://github.com/Bonfida/sns-sdk), in [Go](https://github.com/golang/go). This commit, tagged `0.1.0`, is aim at **correctness** to the [official JS/TS SDK](https://github.com/Bonfida/sns-sdk), which has been achieved by the merits of passing all the tests in the native SDK. This commit tries to resemble very much of the conventions in the native SDK, such has directory naming, file naming, variable and function names (a little optimization there) but still carries the power of Golang concurency (goroutines) anywhere it was needed.

### WHY GO

Aside from the team‚Äôs mission to develop a Go library, JavaScript/Type~~Script~~ is fundamentally a browser-oriented language‚Äîit is good software to keep it at that.

### TESTS

All tests passed, but two issues remain. However, these seem to stem from the native SDK‚Äôs testing library rather than the Go library. When run normally, these functions produce different results‚Äîmatching the expected output from the JS & Go implementation. A commit addressing additional test issues exists but hasn‚Äôt been merged into the main branch yet (hopefully, that resolves it). The specific issues are outlined below.

- resolve(resolve.test.ts): last testcase should throw named error.

```go
{
    name:   "Test case 4",
    domain: "sns-ip-5-wallet-12",
    err:    string(spl.InvalidRoA), // it should be  string(splWrongValidation),
},
```

- getTokenizedDomain (nft.test.ts): the getProgramAccounts returns empty array

- and there is this last one ` "Test case 1/Create & delete instruction",` from twitter/deleteTwitterRegistry.\_test.go, it passes in the native sdk but fails on my end (should be fixed in the next commit).

### WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR

The majority of the native codebase has been ported‚Äîabout 95%. The remaining parts are likely deprecated or no longer in use. At this point, I‚Äôd like the team to get involved and share their thoughts on how we should move forward and complete the remaining work. This commit aligns with the native SDK at commit `c1abc4d9f027f87835cbcd2473cbc51cf43abb58` on origin/main.

### MY MISSION

It‚Äôs time for Go to power Solana backend systems! Huge thanks to the devs that cooked üçö [solana-go](github.com/gagliardetto/solana-go").


### SETUP

The .env file
```bash
RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
TEST_PRIVATE_KEY=4B12eot34GyfDBcP7SCMb4r2H13tjuGkTKpgB9fpNZrq1iaNmrDpAS9xDDUVzoEiUjZiybFShX5UEhmhGWnFggj6
TEST_PUBLIC_KEY=12vQ7TQYPxUscvAfBAuf3pdiPAFRhC26qGCjztLfw7zk
```
If you‚Äôre using VS Code, you can streamline your workflow with the built-in testing UI. However, you‚Äôll need to place the .env file in each directory where tests are executed, as VS Code uses the test‚Äôs directory as the working directory.
